# OpenSCAD Preview Skill

Render OpenSCAD files to PNG images so you can visually verify your work.

## Usage

```
/preview-scad <file.scad> [options]
```

## Workflow

1. After creating or editing a `.scad` file, run this skill to render a preview
2. Read the generated PNG image to visually inspect the result
3. If the result doesn't look right, fix the code and re-render
4. Repeat until the design matches the requirements

## Running the Render Script

```bash
.claude/skills/preview-scad/scripts/render-scad.sh <input.scad> [options]
```

### Options

- `--output <path>` - Custom output path (default: `<input>_preview.png`)
- `--size <WxH>` - Image dimensions (default: `800x600`)
- `--camera <x,y,z,tx,ty,tz,d>` - Camera position (default: auto-center)
- `--colorscheme <name>` - Color scheme (default: `Cornfield`)
- `--render` - Full render mode (slower, more accurate)
- `--preview` - Preview mode (faster, default)

## Example

After creating `phone_stand.scad`:

```bash
.claude/skills/preview-scad/scripts/render-scad.sh phone_stand.scad
```

Then read the generated `phone_stand_preview.png` to see the result.

## Visual Feedback Loop

When working on OpenSCAD designs:

1. Write/edit the .scad file
2. Render preview with this skill
3. Read the PNG image to see what was created
4. Evaluate: Does it match what the user asked for?
   - If yes: You're done
   - If no: Identify what's wrong, fix the code, and repeat from step 2

This iterative process helps ensure the final design meets requirements.

## Next Steps

Once the preview looks correct:

1. **Export to STL**: Use `/export-stl` to convert to printable format with geometry validation

## Full Pipeline

```
/openscad → /preview-scad → /export-stl (with validation)
```
